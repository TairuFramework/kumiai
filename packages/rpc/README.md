# @kumiai/rpc

High-level, MLS-aware group RPC for Enkaku. Wraps the pub/sub hub and the
broadcast primitives so a group is a first-class messaging substrate: address
the whole group (events), a subgroup, anycast a request, gather replies, or run
directed 1:1 RPC (request/stream/channel) to a single member — all over
epoch-rotating opaque topics, with an authenticated sender on every surface.
