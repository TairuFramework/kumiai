Add transactional memory persistence and lossless MLS/recovery v2 storage codecs; refuse ambiguous v1 snapshots.

Run memory group and device persistence through the D8 FIFO ownership queues and phase-bound capabilities. Remove the public GroupMutationGate and MemoryDatabase.mutationGate APIs.

Capture host effects before finalise to preserve getter errors and avoid unhandled fail-stop rejections. Keep non-mutating store refusals separate from fatal seal and required-open failures. Ownership is runtime-neutral with an optional ownershipContext port.
Ignore revoked attempts' late failures, reject roots invoked by argument getters, roll back admitted required-read failures, and promptly reject failed Reads.
